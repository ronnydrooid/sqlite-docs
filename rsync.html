<h1 id="overview"><span>1. </span>Overview</h1>

<p>The following command causes REPLICA to become a copy of ORIGIN:

</p><div class="codeblock"><pre>$ sqlite3_rsync ORIGIN REPLICA ?OPTIONS?
</pre></div>

<p>Use the <code>--help</code> or <code>-?</code> flag to see the
complete list of options. Option flags may appear before, after, or
between the ORIGIN and REPLICA arguments.</p>

<p>Add the <code>-v</code> option to see more output, in a format
similar to "rsync".

</p><h1 id="features"><span>2. </span>Features</h1>

<ol>

  <li>One or the other of ORIGIN or REPLICA may be of the form
  "USER@HOST:PATH". The other is just a simple PATH.
   This utility causes REPLICA to become a copy of ORIGIN.

    <ol type="a">
      <li><p>If REPLICA does not already exist, it is created.</p></li>

      <li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">ssh</a>
      is used for communication, so "USER@HOST" may be an SSH
      alias.</p></li>

      <li><p>It is not required that one of ORIGIN or REPLICA be remote.
      The sqlite3_rsync utility works fine if both ORIGIN and REPLICA are
      local.

      </p></li></ol>
  </li>

  <li><p>Both databases may be "live" while this utility is
  running. Other programs can have active connections to the
  databases on either end while this utility is running.  Other
  programs can write to ORIGIN and can read from REPLICA while
  this utility runs.
  </p><p>
  REPLICA becomes a copy of a snapshot of ORIGIN as it existed when the
  sqlite3_rsync command started.  If other processes change the content
  of ORIGIN while this command is running, those changes will be applied
  to ORIGIN, but they are not transferred to REPLICA
  Thus, REPLICA ends up as a fully-consistent snapshot of ORIGIN
  at an instant in time.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>The synchronization uses a bandwidth-efficient
  protocol, similar to <a href="https://rsync.samba.org">rsync</a>
  (from which its name is derived).</p></li>

</ol>

<h1 id="limitations"><span>3. </span>Limitations</h1>

<ol>

  <li><p></p><s>The database files must both be in <a href="wal.html">WAL</a> mode, and must have the
  same page-size.</s> &larr; This limitation was removed in
  version 3.50.0 (2025-05-29).</li>

  <li><p>While sqlite3_rsync is running, REPLICA is read-only.
  Queries can be run against REPLICA while this utility is running,
  just not write transactions.</p></li>

  <li><p>Only a single database is synchronized for each invocation of
  this utility.  It is not (yet) possible to synchronize many different
  databases using wildcards, as it is with standard "rsync".

  </p></li><li><p>At least one of ORIGIN or REPLICA must be on the local machine.
  They cannot both be databases on other machines.

  </p></li><li><p>On the remote system, this utility must be installed in one of
  the directories in the default $PATH for SSH.  The
  <code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory is often a good choice.
  Alternately, the <code>--exe
  NAME</code> flag may be used to specify a remote location for the
  binary, e.g. <code>--exe /opt/bin/sqlite3_rsync</code>.</p></li>

  <li><p>The replica will be a very close copy of the origin, but not
  an exact copy.  All of the table (and index) content will be byte-for-byte
  identical in the replica.  However, there can be some minor changes in
  the <a href="fileformat2.html#database_header">database header</a>.  In particular, the replica will have the following
  differences from the origin:
     </p><ol type="a">
     <li><p>
     The <a href="fileformat2.html#chngctr">change counter</a> in bytes 24 through 27 of the database header
     might be incremented in the replica.

     </p></li><li><p>
     The <a href="fileformat2.html#validfor">version-valid-for number</a> in bytes in 96 through 99 of the
     database header will be the SQLite version number of the
     sqlite3_rsync program that made the copy, not the version number of
     the last writer to the origin database.
     </p></li></ol>

  </li><li><p>On Windows, a single-letter HOST without a USER@ prefix will
  be interpreted as a Windows drive-letter, not as a hostname.</p></li>

</ol>

<h1 id="how_to_install"><span>4. </span>How To Install</h1>

<p>Install sqlite3_rsync simply by putting the executable somewhere
on your $PATH.  If you are synchronizing with a remote system, the
sqlite3_rsync executable must be installed on both the local and the
remote system.  When installing the sqlite3_rsync executable on the
remote system, ensure that it is found on the $PATH used by SSH.
Putting the sqlite3_rsync executable in the /usr/local/bin directory
is often a good choice.

</p><p>Unfortunately, on MacOS, the default PATH for ssh is
"/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin" and MacOS does not allow you to
add new programs to any of those directories.  As a work-around,
sqlite3_rsync will attempt to augment the PATH like this:
</p><blockquote>
PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
</blockquote>
<p>So if you are trying to sync with a remote Mac, it should suffice
to install the sqlite3_rsync binary in any of the three new PATH
locations:
</p><ul>
<li> $HOME/bin
</li><li> /usr/local/bin
</li><li> /opt/homebrew/bin
</li></ul>

<p>If you need to install sqlite3_rsync in some other (non-standard)
place on the remote machine, simply use the --exe option on the command
line to specify its precise location.  For example:

</p><blockquote>
sqlite3_rsync sample.db mac:sample.db --exe /some/weird/place/sqlite3_rsync
</blockquote>

<p>The writer of this document has never had any success in getting
SSHD to run on Windows.  Perhaps he will figure that out and be able to
provide instructions for syncing a database to or from a remote Windows
machine in a future release.

</p><h2 id="backwards_compatibility_issues"><span>4.1. </span>Backwards-Compatibility Issues</h2>

<p>The sqlite3_rsync program is designed to negotiate the details of
the sync algorithm between the origin and the replica at startup, and
to use the most advanced algorithm available on both sides.  However,
due to a bug in this algorithm negotiation logic (a missing fflush()
call) it is possible for the application to hang if you try to use
sqlite3_rsync with version 3.50.0 or later on the local side of the
connection with version 3.49.1 or earlier on the remote side.
Your best solution to
this is to install the latest version of sqlite3_rsync on both sides.
But if that is not possible, you can work around the problem by adding
the "--protocol 1" option to the sqlite3_rsync command-line.

</p><h1 id="network_bandwidth"><span>5. </span>Network Bandwidth</h1>

<p>The core idea behind the protocol is that the replica sends
cryptographic hashes for pages or groups of pages over to the
origin side.  The origin sends back page content that differs, or requests
finer-grain hashes if a multi-page hash does not match.  If the origin
and replica start out being vastly different, the total network bandwidth
can exceed the size of the entire database, due to the overhead of exchanging
hashes, but the excess bandwidth is not great - a few percent at most.
On the other hand, if the origin and replica start out being very
similar (the usual case) then the total bandwidth is often less than
0.01% of the database size.  In tests, a 500MB database will typically
synchronize with about 20KB of network traffic.

</p><p>Prior to version 3.50.0 (2025-05-29), the protocol would only
send hashes of individual pages, not groups of pages.  The meant that the
bandwidth requirements were usually at least about 0.5% of the database size,
even if the two sides started out being identical.  Version 3.50.0 and later
is more bandwidth efficient if there are few differences between the origin
and replica.  However, both sides of the connection must have sqlite3_rsync
version 3.50.0 or later installed or else the protocol falls back to the
older and less bandwidth-efficient algorithm.

</p><h1 id="why_can_t_i_just_use_ordinary_rsync_"><span>6. </span>Why Can't I Just Use Ordinary <tt>rsync</tt>?</h1>

<p>Ordinary rsync does not understand SQLite transactions.  Rsync will make a
copy of ORIGIN into REPLICA, however the copy might not be consistent.  Parts
of the copy might be from one transaction, while other parts might from
a different transaction.  The database copy might be corrupt.

</p><p>If no other processes are connected to the database for the entire
time that rsync is running, and if the database does not have a
<a href="fileformat2.html#hotjrnl">hot journal</a>, then rsync will make a consistent copy of the database.
But if you cannot guarantee that both of those conditions are met, then
rsync might generate a corrupt copy.  The sqlite3_rsync utility, on the
other hand, always generates a consistent copy.
